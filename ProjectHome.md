sdlgraph is a wrapper which reimplements the functionality of the Turbo Pascal GRAPH unit using SDL4Freepascal. This means you need to have SDL4Freepascal installed, which in turn means you need to have at least the SDL run-time libraries installed.

The project is still in its beginning stages, as I find time to work on it.
