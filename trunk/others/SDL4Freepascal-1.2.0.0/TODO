* Implement sdl_SysWM* structures (in a 'portable' fashion)
    I should make a different structure for each platform and choose with
    {$ifdef}s... It's done that way in <SDL/sdl_syswm.h>. Now they're empty
    structures, regardless of the platform.

* Get a better name for sdl__rwops
    The reason for the double underscore is that there is a structure there
    called SDL_rwops, and I can't repeat that identifier in the unit name
    (and don't want to change the name of the record). If you find a better idea 
    for a name of this unit, tell me.
    
* Find a better solution for the stdio.pp issue
    Read the source. This unit is a hack.
    
* Test it!!!!
    I've just barely tested some part of it. There's almost no code, just 
    external definitions, so it won't be very bad, but you never know...
    At least it compiles :-)
    
* Packages (source&binary RPM/DEBs)
    instead of this ugly tarball...

* Remaining SDL modules 
    active, byteorder, endian, error, main, mutex, quit, thread,
    version are not implemented yet. I'll do this soon (I may decide
    not to implement some of them)...

* Make a real build/install/clean script
    The current one only builds, and compiles some units twice (Ok, I know,
    I should write a Makefile)
