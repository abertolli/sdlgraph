     be tested using the SDL_BUTTON(X) function, and x and y are set to the
     current mouse cursor position.

  {
     Retrieve the current state of the mouse.
     The current button state is returned as a button bitmask, which can
     be tested using the SDL_BUTTON(X) function, and x and y are set to the
     mouse deltas since the last call to SDL_GetRelativeMouseState.
    }

  {
     Create a cursor using the specified data and mask (in MSB format).
     The cursor width must be a multiple of 8 bits.
    
     The cursor is created in black and white according to the following:
     data  mask    resulting pixel on screen
      0     1       White
      1     1       Black
      0     0       Transparent
      1     0       Inverted color if possible, black if not.
    
     Cursors created with this function must be freed with SDL_FreeCursor.
    }

     Set the currently active cursor to the specified one.

     represented on the display.

  }

  {
     Toggle whether or not the cursor is shown on the screen.
     The cursor start off displayed, but can be turned off.
     SDL_ShowCursor returns True iff the cursor was being displayed
     before the call. You can query the current state passing a
     'toggle' value of -1
