This demos are like a little tutorial for using SDL4FreePascal (and SDL in
general). They are intended to be read in sequential order; each one assumes
you understood everything used in the previous one.

You're encouraged to change them and play a little*.

I've tried to be clear and explain everything in the code comments,
introducing every new function used. But I may have missed something, so 
please, tell me if it's unclear what a given function does, or why that 
given parameters were necessary, or whatever you think could make these
programs easier to understand for a SDL newcomer. I also need more demos,
please send stuff!

It's also recommended to read the complete explanation in the library comments
(copied from the original comments in the library, written by Sam Lantinga,
SDL's author).

Enjoy!

*You're also encouraged to send me improvements and new demos ;)
