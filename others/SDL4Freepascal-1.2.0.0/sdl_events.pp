      There is one caveat when dealing with the SDL_QUITEVENT event type.  The
      event filter is only called when the window manager desires to close the
      application window.  If the event filter returns 1, then the window will
      be closed, otherwise the window will remain open if possible.
      If the quit event is generated by an interrupt signal, it will bypass the
      internal queue and be delivered to the application at the next event poll.
