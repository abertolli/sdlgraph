  { Include file for SDL custom system window manager hooks  }

  { Your application has access to a special type of event 'SDL_SYSWMEVENT',
     which contains window-manager specific information and arrives whenever
     an unhandled window event occurs.  This event is ignored by default, but
     you can enable it with SDL_EventState()
   }
  type
    pSDL_SysWMinfo = ^SDL_SysWMinfo ;
    SDL_SysWMinfo = record
                      { ***Not implemented*** }
                    end;

    pSDL_SysWMmsg = ^SDL_SysWMmsg ;
    SDL_SysWMmsg = record
                     { ***Not implemented*** }

  { Function prototypes  }
  {
     This function gives you custom hooks into the window manager information.
     It fills the structure pointed to by 'info' with custom information and
     returns 1 if the function is implemented.  If it's not implemented, or
     the version member of the 'info' structure is invalid, it returns 0. 
    }

  function SDL_GetWMInfo(info:pSDL_SysWMinfo):longint;cdecl;external 'SDL';
