  type
  { Function prototype for the timer callback function  }
     SDL_TimerCallback = function (interval:Uint32):Longbool;cdecl;

  { Set a callback to run after the specified number of milliseconds has
     elapsed. The callback function is passed the current timer interval
     and returns the next timer interval.  If the returned value is the 
     same as the one passed in, the periodic alarm continues, otherwise a
     new alarm is scheduled. If the callback returns False, the periodic
     alarm is cancelled. 
    
     To cancel a currently running timer, call SDL_SetTimer(0, nil);
    
     The timer callback function may run in a different thread than your
     main code, and so shouldn't call any functions from within itself.
    
     The maximum resolution of this timer is 10 ms, which means that if
     you request a 16 ms timer, your callback will run approximately 20 ms
     later on an unloaded system.  If you wanted to set a flag signaling
     a frame update at 30 frames per second (every 33 ms), you might set a 
     timer for 30 ms:
       SDL_SetTimer((33 div 10)*10, flag_update);
    
     If you use this function, you need to pass SDL_INIT_TIMER to SDL_Init.
    
     Under UNIX, you should not use raise or use SIGALRM and this function
     in the same program, as it is implemented using setitimer().  You also
     should not use this function in multi-threaded applications as signals
     to multi-threaded apps have undefined behavior in some implementations.

    The callback function is passed the current timer interval and returns
    the next timer interval.  If the returned value is the same as the one
    passed in, the periodic alarm continues, otherwise a new alarm is
    scheduled.  If the callback returns 0, the periodic alarm is cancelled.
